# Python-Baseball_Project
Simple Baseball game simulator using Python

- Current goal is to simulate the game play for a baseball game using Python
   - The program will simply randomize the results of a player at bat (e.g. strike, foul ball, hit, etc.)
     and cycle through each team for each of the nine innings
   - No plans at this time to make it interactive
   - Format is text with possibility of GUI version in the future
