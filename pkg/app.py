"""Baseball Game Simulator

   Python v3.7

   This is a simple simulator that runs through a baseball game. It shows
   the results of each at bat by team for each inning. Results at bat
   are determined at random. If there is a tie after nine innings, the
   game will go into extra innings.

   Primary goal is to use Python as the language and apply the appropriate
   data structures. Future features may be added.
