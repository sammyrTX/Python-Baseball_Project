""" Baseball Project Notes

This project will be a baseball game written in Python. It is simple and will be a basic flow of a game.

1 - Every at bat result will be randomly determined
    each pitch will result in either a:
        a) strike
        b) ball
        c) single
        d) double
        e) triple
        f) grand slam (if bases are loaded)

2 - Code will keep track of results of each inning. 

3 - Player will be choose to be home or visitor.
        a) Player will only intiate each pitch. Result will be random
        b) Computer will play opposing team and will run through defense (small interval count between pitches)
        
4 - Basic loops to run through each at bat, innings

5 - Need algorithm to keep track of players that make a hit and keep count of score

6 - Try to create a simple table that shows the scores for each inning. Also (H)its, (R)uns & (E)rrors

Additional Notes:


start inning

start with visitors team

get next batter

initialize variables for strikes, fouls, outs & balls to zero

generate pitch result

if pitch is strike, strike += 1
	if pitch == 3
		out +=1
		break to next batter

if pitch is ball, ball +=1
	if ball == 4 -> walk batter > execute advance runners using WALK
	break to next batter

if pitch is foul
	if foul > 2 break
	else foul += 1 and strikes += 1

if pitch is foul out, outs += 1

if pitch is an out, outs +=1

if pitch is a hit (single through homer/grand slam), advance runner(s) based on hit type
	execute advance runner function
	break to next batter

before next batter check the following
	if outs == 3, stop and switch to next team
	get next batter in lineup
		if lineup is empty, get copy of lineup and begin
	resume and get pitch result

if outs == 3

	switch to next team
		if next team is home team, continue inning
		if visitors and home team have batted, proceed to next inning

if next inning > 9 (or list is exhausted) >>> end game and show final box score
